He could only earn a living from journalism, however, and predicted the book would not see a release before 1947. [18] Progress was slow going; by the end of September 1945 Orwell had written some 50 pages. [21] Orwell became disenchanted with the restrictions and pressures involved with journalism and grew to detest city life in London.

       " Document(page_content='The novel was completed at Barnhill, Jura. In May 1946, Orwell arrived on the Scottish island of Jura. [20] He had wanted to retreat to a Hebridean island for several years, to which David Astor recommended he stay at Barnhill, a remote farmhouse on the island that his family owned. [24] Barnhill had no electricity or hot water, but it was here where Orwell intermittently drafted and finished Nineteen Eighty-Four. [20] His first stay lasted until October 1946, during which time he made little progress on the few already completed pages and at one point, did no work on it for three months. [25] After spending the winter in London, Orwell returned to Jura; in May 1947 he reported to Warburg that despite progress being slow and difficult, he was roughly a third of the way through. [26] He sent his \"ghastly mess\" of a first draft manuscript to London where Miranda Christen volunteered to type a clean version. [27] Orwell\\'s health took a turn in September, however, and he was confined to bed with inflammation of the lungs. He lost almost two stone (28 pounds or 12.7 kg) in weight and had recurring night sweats, but he decided not to see a doctor and continued writing. [28] On 7 November 1947, he completed the first draft in bed and subsequently travelled to East Kilbride near Glasgow for medical treatment at Hairmyres Hospital, where a specialist confirmed a chronic and infectious case of tuberculosis.

       " Document(page_content='Orwell was discharged in the summer of 1948, after which he returned to Jura and produced a full second draft of Nineteen Eighty-Four, which he finished in November. He asked Warburg to have someone come to Barnhill and retype the manuscript, which was so untidy that the task was only considered possible if Orwell was present, as only he could understand it. The previous volunteer had left the country and no other could be found at short notice, so an impatient Orwell retyped it himself at a rate of roughly 4,000 words a day during bouts of fever and bloody coughing fits. [27] On 4 December 1948, Orwell sent the finished manuscript to Secker & Warburg and left Barnhill for good in January 1949. He recovered at a sanitarium in the Cotswolds.

[30] Warburg suggested the latter, which he took to be a more commercially viable choice. [31] There has been a theory – doubted by Dorian Lynskey (author of a 2019 book about Nineteen Eighty-Four) – that 1984 was chosen simply as an inversion of the year 1948, the year in which it was being completed. Lynskey says the idea was \"first suggested by Orwell\\'s US publisher\", and it was also mentioned by Christopher Hitchens in his introduction to the 2003 edition of Animal Farm and 1984, which also notes that the date was meant to give \"an immediacy and urgency to the menace of totalitarian rule\".
